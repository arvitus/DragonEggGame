# The distance in blocks around the Dragon Egg where players count as 'nearby'
nearby-range = 64
# Actions that are executed on certain triggers.
# You can specify different actions and also specify a condition that must be met for the action to run.
#
# Available triggers:
#     - 'deg:block' - When the egg is placed as a block.
#     - 'deg:item' - When the egg becomes an item (e.g. is dropped).
#     - 'deg:inventory' - When the egg is placed in a block inventory (e.g. chest).
#     - 'deg:entity' - When the egg is placed in an entity inventory (e.g. item frame, chest boat)
#     - 'deg:player' - When the egg enters a players inventory.
#     - 'deg:falling_block' - When the egg becomes a falling block entity.
#     - 'deg:second' - Every second.
# NOTE: All entities (items, falling blocks, players, etc.) will trigger multiple times if they move while holding the egg.
#
# The following placeholders are available in commands and use the format {{<placeholder>}}:
#     - 'bearer' - The name of the bearer.
#     - 'bearer_id' - The uuid of the bearer.
#     - 'nearby' - Shortcut for '@a[predicate=deg:is_nearby]' (see below).
#
# The Mod also provides two predicates that can be used in commands (also in-game):
#     - 'deg:is_bearer' - Matches the current bearer of the egg.
#     - 'deg:is_nearby' - Matches players within the reward range of the egg.
#
# Additionally, you can use ${<expression>} to calculate a mathematical expression.
# For information on available functions and operators, see: https://www.objecthunter.net/exp4j/
# IMPORTANT: Make sure the result is a format that is compatible with the format expected by the command.
#            Most commands expect integer values, so make sure the calculation results in an integer.
#            The functions 'round(a, b)', 'floor(a)', and 'ceil(a)' can help with that.
# Available variables:
#     - (int) 'bearerTime' - The time in seconds since the last bearer change.
#     - (int) 'blockTime' - The time in seconds since the egg was last placed.
#     - (int) 'totalBlockTime' - The total time in seconds the egg has been placed, since the last bearer change.
#     - (int) 'playerTime' - The time in seconds since the egg has last entered the bearers inventory.
#     - (int) 'totalPlayerTime' - The total time in seconds the egg has been in the bearers inventory, since the last bearer change.
#     - (int) 'itemTime' - The time in seconds since the egg became an item entity.
#     - (int) 'totalItemTime' - The total time in seconds the egg has been an item entity, since the last bearer change.
#     - (int) 'entityTime' - The time in seconds since the egg was last placed in an entity inventory (not player).
#     - (int) 'totalEntityTime' - The total time in seconds the egg has been in an entity inventory (not player), since the last bearer change.
#     - (int) 'invTime' - The time in seconds since the egg was last placed in a block inventory.
#     - (int) 'totalInvTime' - The total time in seconds the egg has been in a block inventory, since the last bearer change.
#     - (int) 'fallingTime' - The time in seconds since the egg became a falling block entity.
#     - (int) 'totalFallingTime' - The total time in seconds the egg has been a falling block entity, since the last bearer change.
#     - (double) 'x' - The X coordinate of the egg, at the center of the block.
#     - (double) 'y' - The Y coordinate of the egg, at the center of the block.
#     - (double) 'z' - The Z coordinate of the egg, at the center of the block.
#     - (int) 'randX' - The randomized X block coordinate of the egg.
#     - (int) 'randY' - The randomized Y block coordinate of the egg.
#     - (int) 'randZ' - The randomized Z block coordinate of the egg.
# Additional functions:
#     - rnd(a) - returns a pseudo random number between 0 and a (0 <= rnd(a) < a)
#     - min(a, b) - returns the smaller of a and b
#     - max(a, b) - returns the larger of a and b
#     - round(a, b) - rounds a to b decimal places
# Additional operators:
#     - '==' - equals (returns 1 if true and 0 otherwise)
#     - '!=' - not equals (returns 1 if true and 0 otherwise)
#     - '<' - less than (returns 1 if true and 0 otherwise)
#     - '>' - greater than (returns 1 if true and 0 otherwise)
#     - '<=' - less than or equal (returns 1 if true and 0 otherwise)
#     - '>=' - greater than or equal (returns 1 if true and 0 otherwise)
#     - '&&' - logical and (returns 0 if at least one value is 0 and 1 otherwise)
#     - '||' - logical or (returns 0 if both values are 0 and 1 otherwise)
